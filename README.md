## Introduction

This sample shows how to connect an AngularJS app to a Microsoft work or school (Azure Active Directory) or personal (Microsoft) account  using the Microsoft Graph API with the [Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-javascript) to send an email. In addition, the sample uses the Office Fabric UI for styling and formatting the user experience.

This sample uses the [Microsoft Authentication Library Preview for JavaScript (msal.js)](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js) to get an access token.

## Prerequisites

To use the Microsoft Graph Connect sample for AngularJS, you need the following:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Node is required to run the sample on a development server and to install dependencies. 

* [Bower](https://bower.io). Bower is required to install front-end dependencies.

* Either a [Microsoft account](https://www.outlook.com) or [Office 365 for business account](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/howto/setup-development-environment#bk_Office365Account)

## Register the application

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) to register an application.

1. If your account gives you access to more than one tenant, select your account in the top right corner, and set your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

1. In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations (Preview) > New registration**.

1. When the **Register an application** page appears, enter a name for your application.

1. Under **Supported Microsoft accounts**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts**.

1. Select the **Web** platform under the **Redirect URI** section and set the value to *http://localhost:8080/*.

1. When finished, select **Register**.  On the app **Overview** page, note down the **Application ID** value.

1. This quickstart requires the [Implicit grant flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow) to be enabled. In the left-hand navigation pane of the registered application, select **Authentication**.

1. In **Advanced settings**, under **Implicit grant**, enable both **ID tokens** and **Access tokens** checkboxes. ID tokens and Access tokens are required since this app needs to sign in users and call an API.

1. Select **Save**.

## Build and run the sample

1. Download or clone the Microsoft Graph Connect Sample for AngularJS.

2. Using your favorite IDE, open **config.js** in *public/scripts*.

3. Replace the **clientID** placeholder value with the application ID of your registered Azure application.

4. In a command prompt, run the following command in the root directory. This installs the Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK and other dependencies.

  ```
npm install
bower install
  ```
  
5. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

6. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

7. Choose the **Connect** button.

8. Sign in with your personal or work or school account and grant the requested permissions.

9. Optionally edit the recipient's email address, and then choose the **Send mail** button. When the mail is sent, a Success message is displayed below the button.
